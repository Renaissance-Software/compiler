 // @TODO: This test crashes the compiler because a return has been emitted after all paths emitted a return
 // Think of skipping the dead code. How?
 // @UPDATE: this is no longer crashing. We are skipping the rest of the block statements; the return is implicit Is this approach any good? - davidgm94 - April 3, 2021
